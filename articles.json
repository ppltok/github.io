This approach goes beyond accessibility, aiming to create solutions that work better for everyone. In the digital realm, inclusive design principles are being applied to websites and apps to ensure they are usable by people with various disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Companies are also focusing on inclusive design in physical products, from household items to automotive design. In urban planning, inclusive design is shaping more accessible and welcoming public spaces. The fashion industry is embracing inclusive design through adaptive clothing lines and extended size ranges. In the workplace, inclusive design principles are being applied to create more accommodating and flexible work environments. This shift towards inclusive design is not just ethically driven but also makes business sense, as it opens up products and services to a broader market. Moreover, solutions designed for edge cases often lead to innovations that benefit all users.
